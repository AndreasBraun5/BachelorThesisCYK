\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

The starting point of this thesis is to get a tool to automatically generate a suitable 4-tuple $exercise = (grammar,\ word,\ parse\ table,\ derivation\ tree)$, that is used to test if the students have understood the way of working of the CYK algorithm.\\
Various implementations and small online tools of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm can be found [XXX]. Nevertheless it is required to automatically generate suitable $exercise$s, that afterwards can be modified as wanted. This is the reason an own implementation has been made. It is also a task to find a more clever algorithm to automatically generate $exercise$s with a high chance of being suitable as an exam exercise.

\subsection{Context Free Grammar}
\begin{DefGrey} \textbf{Context Free Grammar (CFG)}\\
	We define a CFG as the 4-tuple $G=(V,\ \Sigma,\ S,\ P)$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $V$ is a finite set of variables.
		\item $\Sigma$ is an alphabet
		\item $S$ is the start symbol and $S \in V$.
		\item $P$ is a finite set of rules: $P \subseteq V \times (V \cup \Sigma)^{*}$.
	\end{itemize}
	It is valid that $\Sigma \cap V =  \emptyset$.
\end{DefGrey}
\begin{DefGrey}\label{CFGinCNF} \textbf{CFG with restrictions}\\
	A CFG $G=(V,\ \Sigma,\ S,\ P)$ is in CNF iff.:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $P \subseteq V \times (V^2 \cup \Sigma)^{*}$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{DefGrey}
\noindent Throughout this thesis a grammar is always synonymous with Definition \ref{CFGinCNF}. For further convenience the following default values are always true:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $V = \{A, B, ...\}$
	\item $(V^2 \cup\ \Sigma)^{*}=\{a, b, ...\} \cup \{AA, AB, BB, BA, BS, AC, ... \}$
\end{itemize}
A rule consists out of a left hand side element (lhse) and a right hand side element (rhse). Example: $lhse \longrightarrow rhse$ applied to $A \longrightarrow c$ and $B \longrightarrow AC$ means that $A$ and $B$ are a $lhse$ and $c$ and $AC$ are a $rhse$.
\begin{DefGrey}\label{wordLanguage} \textbf{Word $w$ and language $L(G)$}\\
	Word $w$ and language $L(G)$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $w \in \Sigma^* = \{w_0,~w_1,~...,~w_j\}$.
		\item A language $L(G)$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is a set of words over $\Sigma$ .
	\end{itemize}
\end{DefGrey}
\noindent Moreover in the context of talking about sets, a set is always described beginning with an upper case letter, while one specific element of a set is described beginning with a lower case letter. Example: A "$Pyramid$" is a set consisting of multiple "$Cell$"s, whereas a $Cell$ is again a subset of the set of variables "$V$". A "$cellElement$" is one specific element of a "$Cell$". (For further reasoning behind this example see chapter XXX "help data structure") 
\subsection{General approaches} \label{approaches}
Two basic approaches, that may help finding a good algorithm are explained informally.
\subsubsection{Forward Problem \& Backward Problem}
The Forward Problem and the Backward Problem are two ways as how to determine if $w \in L(G)$.	
\begin{DefGrey}
	\textbf{Forward Problem ($G \xrightarrow[]{derivation} w$)} \\
	Input: Grammar $G$ in CNF. \\
	Output: Derivation $d$ that shows implicitly $w \subseteq L$.
\end{DefGrey}
\noindent It is called Forward Problem, if you are given a grammar $G$ and form a derivation from its root node to a final word $w$. The final word $w$ is always element of $L(G)$.
\begin{DefGrey}
	\textbf{Backward Problem = Parsing ($w\overset{?}{\subseteq}L(G)$)}\\
	Input: $w$ and a grammar $G$ in CNF. \\
	Output: $w \subseteq L(G) \Longrightarrow$ derivation $d$.
\end{DefGrey}
\noindent If you are given a word $w$ and want to determine if it is element of $L(G)$, it is called Backward Problem or parsing.
\subsubsection{Parsing Bottom-Up \& Top-Down}
There are again two ways to classify the approach of parsing.
\begin{DefGrey}
	\textbf{Bottom-Up parsing} \\
	 Bottom-Up parsing means to start parsing from the leaves up to the root node.
\end{DefGrey}
\noindent "Bottom-Up parsing is the general method used in the Cocke-Younger-Kasami(CYK) algorithm, which fills a parse table from the "bottom up""[Duda 8.6.3 page 426].
\begin{DefGrey}
	\textbf{Top-Down parsing} \\
	 Top-Down parsing means to start parsing from the node down to the leaves.
\end{DefGrey}
\noindent "Top-Down parsing starts with the root node and successively applies productions from $P$, with the goal of finding a derivation of the test sentence $w$." [XXX] (The so called test sentence is synonymous to an word $w$.)
Reasonably criteria to guide the choice of which rewrite rule to apply could include to begin the parsing at the first (left) or last (right) character of the word $w$ [XXX][Duda 8.6.3 page 428]

\subsection{Data Structure Pyramid}
To be able to describe the way of working of the different algorithms easier the help data structure $Pyramid$ will be defined \textendash~note that $Pyramid$ starts with upper case and therefore is a set). But before that:
\begin{DefGrey} \textbf{$[i, j]$} \\
	$[i,\ j] := \{i,\ i+1,..., j-1,\ j\} \subseteq \mathbb{N}_{\geq 0}$.
\end{DefGrey}

\begin{DefGrey} \textbf{$Cell_{i,j}$} \\
	$Cell_{i,j} \subseteq \{(V,k)~|~k \in \mathbb{N} \}$
\end{DefGrey}
\noindent Now $Pyramid$ can be defined as following:
\begin{DefGrey} \textbf{$Pyramid$} \\
	$Pyramid :=\{ Cell_{i,j}\ |\ i \in [0,\ i_{max}],\  j \in [0,\ j_{max,i}],\ i_{max} = |w|-1,~j_{max,i} = i_{max} -i\}$.
\end{DefGrey}
\noindent The following is the visual representation of a $Pyramid$ that additionally has written the word $w$ above it:

\subsection{ Cocke-Younger-Kasami Algorithm}
The Cocke-Younger-Kasami Algorithm (CYK) has been developed independently in the 1960s by Itiroo Sakai, John Cocke, Tadao Kasami, Jacob Schwartz and Daniel Younger that uses the principle of dynamic programming. [wiki and the four sources]\\
The description of the algorithm follows [TI Hofmann] adjusted to the help data structure $Pyramid$. \\

		Line \ref{true}: True iff $Cell_{i_{max},0}$ contains the start variable.
		}
	\end{algorithm}
}


\subsection{Success Rates}
\noindent Success Rates ($SR$) are used to compare the algorithms accounting to their performance of the different requirements. $N \in  \mathbb{N}$ is the count of all generated grammars of the examined algorithm.\\

\noindent\textbf{Success Rate:}
An generated $exercise$ contributes to the Success Rate ($SR$) iff it contributes to the SR-Producibility, to the SR-Cardinality-Rules and to the SR-Pyramid at the same time.\\
It holds: $SR = n / N$, whereas $n$ is the count of $exercises$ that fulfil the requirements in this case.\\

\noindent\textbf{Success Rate Producibility:}
An generated $exercise$ contributes to the SR-Producibility iff the CYK algorithm's output (Algorithm \ref{CYK}) is true.\\
It holds: SR-Producibility $ = p / N$, whereas $p$ is the count of $exercises$ that fulfil the requirement.\\

\noindent\textbf{Success Rate Cardinality-Rules}
An generated $exercise$ contributes to the SR-Cardinality-Rules iff the grammar has got less than a certain amount of productions.\\
It is true: SR-Cardinality-Rules $ = cr / N$, whereas $cr$ is the count of $exercises$ that fulfil this requirement.\\

\noindent\textbf{Success Rate Pyramid}
An generated $exercise$ contributes to the SR-Pyramid iff the following conditions are met:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item At least one cell forces a right cell combination.
	\item There are less than a certain amount of variables in the entire pyramid, per default 100.
	\item There are less than a certain amount of variables in each cell of the pyramid, per default 3.
\end{enumerate}
It holds: SR-Pyramid $= p / N$, whereas $p$ is the count of $exercises$ that fulfil the requirements above.\\
While checking 1., 2. and 3. a simplification of $Cell_{i,j}$ is done:\\ $Cell_{i,j} \subseteq \{(V,k)~|~k \in \mathbb{N} \} \longrightarrow Cell_{i,j} \subseteq V$ See the following example:

}


\noindent As seen in Figure \ref{foreCombination} the variables in $Cell_{2,0}$ and in $Cell_{2,1}$ force each a right cell combination. In both cases $VarComp=\{SS\}$. The variable $v=C$ doesn't have $SS$ as one of its rhses. Therefore the variable $C$ forces.
$Cell_{3,0}$ doesn't force because $VarComp=\{CC\}$ and the variable $v=S$ has $CC$ as its rhse. Remember that cells with index $i\leq1$ can't force at all.
