\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
The starting point of this thesis is to get a tool to automatically generate a suitable 4-tuple $exercise = (grammar,\ word,\ parse\ table,\ derivation\ tree)$, that is used to test if the students have properly understood how the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm works.\\
Various implementations and small online tools of the CYK algorithm can be found \cite{cykImpl1} \cite{cykImpl2} \cite{cykImpl3}. Nevertheless it is required to automatically generate suitable $exercise$s, that afterwards can be modified as wanted. This is the reason an own implementation has been made. It is also a task to find a more clever algorithm to automatically generate $exercise$s with a high chance of being suitable as an exam exercise.

\subsection{Context Free Grammar} \label{cfgChapter}
\begin{DefGrey} \textbf{Context Free Grammar (CFG)}\\
	We define a CFG as the 4-tuple $G=(V,\ \Sigma,\ S,\ P)$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $V$ is a finite set of variables.
		\item $\Sigma$ is an alphabet
		\item $S$ is the start symbol and $S \in V$.
		\item $P$ is a finite set of rules: $P \subseteq V \times (V \cup \Sigma)^{*}$.
	\end{itemize}
	It is valid that $\Sigma \cap V =  \emptyset$.
\end{DefGrey}
\begin{DefGrey}\label{CFGinCNF} \textbf{CFG with restrictions}\\
	A CFG $G=(V,\ \Sigma,\ S,\ P)$ has the following restrictions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $P \subseteq V \times (V^2 \cup \Sigma)^{*}$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{DefGrey}
\noindent Throughout this thesis a grammar is always synonymous with Definition \ref{CFGinCNF}. $P$ is not necessarily in CNF because it is possible that there are unreachable variables \textendash~from the starting variable. For further convenience the following default values are always assumed in this thesis:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $V = \{A, B, ...\}$
	\item $(V^2 \cup\ \Sigma)^{*}=\{a, b, ...\} \cup \{AA, AB, BB, BA, BS, AC, ... \}$
\end{itemize}
A rule consists of a left hand side element (lhse) and a right hand side element (rhse). Example: $lhse \longrightarrow rhse$ applied to $A \longrightarrow c$ and $B \longrightarrow AC$ means that $A$ and $B$ are a $lhse$ and $c$ and $AC$ are a $rhse$. Elements of $V^2$ are often referred to as variable compounds.
\begin{DefGrey}\label{wordLanguage} \textbf{Word $w$ and language $L(G)$}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Word: $w \in \Sigma^* = w_0\cdot w_1\cdot ...\cdot w_j$.
		\item Language: $L(G)$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is a set of words over $\Sigma$ .
	\end{itemize}
\end{DefGrey}
\noindent Moreover in the context of talking about sets, a set is always described beginning with an upper case letter, while one specific element of a set is described beginning with a lower case letter. Example: A "$Pyramid$" is a set consisting of multiple "$Cell$"s, whereas a $Cell$ is again a subset of the set of variables "$V$". A "$cellElement$" is one specific element of a "$Cell$". (For further reasoning behind this example see chapter \ref{dataStructurePyramid}) 
\subsection{General approaches} \label{approaches}
Now two basic approaches that may help finding a good algorithm are explained informally like in \cite{Duda.2012}. At first the difference between derivation and parsing and secondly the two different ways of parsing are explained shortly.  
\subsubsection{Forward Problem \& Backward Problem}
The Forward Problem and the Backward Problem are two ways as how to determine if $w \in L(G)$.	
\begin{DefGrey}
	\textbf{Forward Problem ($G \xrightarrow[]{derivation} w$)} \\
	Input: Grammar $G$.\\
	Output: Derivation $d$ that shows implicitly $w \subseteq L$.
\end{DefGrey}
\noindent It is called Forward Problem, if you are given a grammar $G$ and form a derivation from its root node to a final word $w$. The derived word $w$ is always part of $L(G)$.
\begin{DefGrey}
	\textbf{Backward Problem = Parsing ($w\overset{?}{\subseteq}L(G)$)}\\
	Input: $w$ and a grammar $G$. \\
	Output: $w \subseteq L(G) \Longrightarrow$ derivation $d$.
\end{DefGrey}
\noindent If you are given a word $w$ and want to determine if it is element of $L(G)$, it is called Backward Problem or parsing. The Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm does parsing and is the focus here.
\subsubsection{Parsing Bottom-Up \& Top-Down}
After knowing what parsing in general is, it is important to know that there are again two ways to classify the approach of parsing itself.
\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=defColour]
	\textbf{Bottom-Up parsing} \\
Bottom-Up parsing means to start parsing from the leaves up to the root node.
\end{mdframed}
\noindent "Bottom-Up parsing is the general method used in the Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm, which fills a parse table from the "bottom up""\cite{Duda.2012}.
\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=defColour]
	\textbf{Top-Down parsing} \\
	 Top-Down parsing means to start parsing from the root node down to the leaves.
\end{mdframed}
\noindent "Top-Down parsing starts with the root node and successively applies productions from $P$, with the goal of finding a derivation of the test sentence $w$." \cite{Duda.2012} (The so called test sentence is synonymous to an word $w$.) \cite{Duda.2012}.

\subsection{Data Structure Pyramid} \label{dataStructurePyramid}
To be able to describe the way of working of the different algorithms easier the help data structure $Pyramid$ will be defined \textendash~note that $Pyramid$ starts with upper case and therefore is a set. But before that:
\begin{DefGrey} \textbf{$[i, j]$} \\
	$[i,\ j] := \{i,\ i+1,..., j-1,\ j\} \subseteq \mathbb{N}_{\geq 0}$.
\end{DefGrey}

\begin{DefGrey} \textbf{$Cell_{i,j}$} \\
	$Cell_{i,j} \subseteq \{(V,k)~|~k \in \mathbb{N} \}$.
\end{DefGrey}
\noindent Now $Pyramid$ can be defined as following:
\begin{DefGrey} \textbf{$Pyramid$} \\
	$Pyramid :=\{ Cell_{i,j}\ |\ i \in [0,\ i_{max}],\  j \in [0,\ j_{max,i}],\ i_{max} = |w|-1,~j_{max,i} = i_{max} -i\}$.
\end{DefGrey}
\noindent The following is the visual representation of a $Pyramid$.

\subsection{ Cocke-Younger-Kasami Algorithm}
The Cocke-Younger-Kasami Algorithm (CYK) has been developed independently in the 1960s by Itiroo Sakai \cite{Sakai.1962}, John Cocke and Jacob Schwartz \cite{JohnCockeJacobT.Schwartz.1970}, Tadao Kasami \cite{Kasami.1966} and Daniel Younger \cite{YOUNGER.1967} \cite{wikiCYK}.\\
The idea is to find all possible derivations of each subword starting with size one and to consecutively use this information to find all possible derivations with a larger size of the subword up to the size of $w$. Finally it is checked if $w \in L(G)$ through the presence of the start variable in the tip of the pyramid.. \\
The description of the algorithm follows the source \cite{Hoffmann.2015} adjusted to the data structure $Pyramid$. While describing Algorithm \ref{checkForceCombinationPerCell} later on a back reference to the CYK-Algorithm here will be made that points out a similarity.\\

				}
			}
		}
		\If{$(S,i) \in Cell_{i_{max},0}$}{ 
			\Return $true$; \label{true}
		}
		\Return $false$;

		Line \ref{rows}: All rows except the first. \\
		Line \ref{eachCell}: All cells in each row. \\
		Line \ref{cykCellCombs}: All possible cell combinations for each cell. \\
		Line \ref{true}: True iff $Cell_{i_{max},0}$ contains the start variable.
		}
	\end{algorithm}
}
