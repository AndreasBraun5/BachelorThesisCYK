\section{Simple Scoring Model}

\noindent Short preface to the rationale about the scoring model. 
Add diversity criteria = homogenity of the cells to the scoring matrix.

\subsection{Elimination Criteria and Selection Criteria}

\noindent Success rates: 
Producibility: $w \subseteq L(G)$\\
Grammar restricitons: $n=|w|$, maxNumberOfVarsPerCell; \textbf{Delete SuccessRatesGrammarRestrictions class. Move maxNumberOfVarsPerCell to exam restrictions class and use $n$ only as parameter.} \\
Exam restrictions: rightCellCombinationsForcedCount, maxSumOfProductions, maxSumOfVarsInPyramid\\

\noindent Picture of used scoring model without weights here. Maybe one picture together with the next subsection. 

\subsection{Weighting of the criteria}

\noindent Picture of the final used scoring model with weights here. 

\subsection{Direct Ranking vs. Preference Analysis vs. ...}

What method is used to compare the results out of the scoring model.\\
Direct Ranking is the simplest way.
